# Examples

Examples for using RxUI with various front ends can be found in this folder.

Because of the detatched nature of RxUI, and the premise of View Models themselves, each of the example projects will use 
the exact same View Models, Services, and Domain Models. The rest of each application will be built using their respective front end framework.
Hopefully this will demonstrate the value in properly separating object roles in your applications.
